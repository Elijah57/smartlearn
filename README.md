# SmartLearn

[smartlearn](./smartlearn.png)
**SmartLearn** is designed as a
Learning Management
System (LMS) to encourage
and facilitate a simplified
method of acquiring formal
education among the less
privileged children in the
society, thus eliminating the
barriers associated with
finance, distance and
location which are the
primary setbacks to
educational acquisition by
this class of people.

## Our Objectives

- To transform the educational
  system for out-of-school (OOS)
  children in Nigeria by providing
  digital accessibility and a
  personalized classroom learning
  system.
- To provide foundational
  learning skills and literacy boost
  for out-of-school (OOS) children
  and teenagers in Nigeria.

### The Problem

In June 2022, UNICEF Nigeria revealed that 1 in 3
children in Nigeria are out of school (OOS)
making up 15% of the global OOS population
(UNICEF, 2022).
This alarming situation has hindered these
children's academic progress and requires
urgent intervention to tackle the complex
challenges
The identified causes encompass early child
marriage, affordability, poverty, population
increase, conflict, economic barriers,
sociocultural norms, etc.

## To build a Learning

Management System
(LMS) that offers
accessible, engaging, and
personalized classroom
content for children and
teenagers who are OOS
in Nigeria.
